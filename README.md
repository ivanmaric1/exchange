Exchange Master 2

Exchange Master 2 is a newer version of the 'Mjenjaƒçnica_2020' program I made a year ago.

The program is used to exchange foreign currency and should be used in the exchange office.

By clicking on 'Buy' and 'Sell' in the menu, we enter the menus where we can change currencies.

The 'Buy' and 'Sell' pages download the current exchange rate list from the API of the Croatian National Bank.

In the 'Transactions' menu we can see all previous transactions that we can filter.

In the 'Options' menu we can restart the bank, add money to the deposit and pay the money to the bank.

The data is stored in a firebase database.
